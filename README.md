### Usage

1. Login: default username & password: admin / admin (You can also register a new one)

2. By default, you should be at the query page. The first thing to do is setting up parameters in all five questions.

3. Click 'Submit' and now you should be directed to the report page. Since the query needs some time to run, you have to wait until the results are fetched (DO NOT CLOSE OR REFRESH!). After that, all the results will be displayed automatically.

4. Select 'COHORT' or 'KICKOUT' tab, and click 'Download CSV' to download the data as a csv file.
